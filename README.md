# Natify

Natify is an abandoned project, now three years old,
made "quick and dirty" and without serious effort.

It translates compiled Java Bytecode to Java-interoperable C Sourcecode,
making it harder to modify and read.

The effectiveness of such a translation is of multiplicative nature,
proving its benefits only when combined with a Java-level obfuscation beforehand
or a binary-level obfuscation (e.g. Tyrmida or VMProtect) afterwards.

The translation is only ~95% correct, so if you are crazy enough
to do anything about that, feel free to do so, pain and glory await equally.
